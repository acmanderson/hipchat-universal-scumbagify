# hipchat-universal-scumbagify
Did you know you can type `(scumbag)(taft)` into HipChat and it'll add a cool meme hat to a former president? Did you know you can add that hat to any emoticon in HipChat, but you can't add any emoticon in HipChat as a hat to any other emoticon in HipChat? That's dumb. Well now you can! With a nifty bookmarklet, the hottest new web tech, you can make any emoticons scumbagifiable! Of course it only works in your browser and as long as HipChat is open, so tell all your coworkers to use it for maximum results!
## Why?

## Installation
Add the contents of `scumbagify.js` to your bookmarks.
## Use
Click the bookmarklet and enter the name of the emoticon you want to scumbagify sans parentheses, e.g. `forscale`. In HipChat, use it as you would the normal `(scumbag)` emoticon, e.g. `(forscale)(ohmy)`.
